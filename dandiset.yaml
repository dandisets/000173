description: 'In this study, we investigate how transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS)
  modulates neural interaction and response to peripheral electrical limb stimulation
  through intracranial multi-electrode recordings in the rat somatosensory cortex.
  Rats were anesthetized using isoflurane anesthesia at 2%. Recordings were taken
  while delivering peripheral electrical stimulation once every 5 seconds to analyze
  the neural response in the rat S1HL region, before and after ultrasound. We delivered
  ultrasound for 5 minutes in a pulsed pattern at 5 different stimulation repetition
  frequencies (10 Hz, 50 Hz, 75 Hz, 100 Hz, and 125 Hz) to induce frequency dependent
  plasticity in a manner similar to that found following tetanic electrical stimulation.
  The fundamental frequency of ultrasound used was 0.5 MHz, the pulse repetition frequency
  (PRF) was 3 kHz, and the total duty cycle was 36%. This dataset includes spike timing
  data from the recordings including time before and after ultrasound stimulation,
  for both true ultrasound conditions and sham ultrasound conditions in which ultrasound
  is directed off target. Details of the study are in the following publication: S.
  Ramachandran, X. Niu, K. Yu, B. He, "Transcranial ultrasound neuromodulation induces
  neuronal correlation change in the rat somatosensory cortex", 2022 J. Neural Eng.

  if you would use a portion of the data. '
